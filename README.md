## 📌 Project Overview

**TrafficTelligence** leverages machine learning techniques to estimate traffic volume based on historical traffic data, weather conditions, and other real-world factors. The system aims to assist:

- Urban planners in optimizing traffic flow
- Commuters in better route planning
- Government bodies in smarter infrastructure decisions

---

## 🧠 Key Technologies

- **Machine Learning** – Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, LSTM
- **TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn** – for model building
- **Flask** – backend API and routing
- **HTML + Tailwind CSS** – immersive frontend UI
- **Particles.js & JS** – animation overlays
- **Google Colab/Jupyter** – for model training and evaluation
