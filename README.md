## 📌 Project Overview

**TrafficTelligence** leverages machine learning techniques to estimate traffic volume based on historical traffic data, weather conditions, and other real-world factors. The system aims to assist:

* Urban planners in optimizing traffic flow
* Commuters in better route planning
* Government bodies in smarter infrastructure decisions

---

## 🧠 Key Technologies

* **Machine Learning** – Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, LSTM
* **TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn** – for model building
* **Flask** – backend API and routing
* **HTML + Tailwind CSS** – immersive frontend UI
* **Particles.js & JS** – animation overlays
* **Google Colab/Jupyter** – for model training and evaluation
