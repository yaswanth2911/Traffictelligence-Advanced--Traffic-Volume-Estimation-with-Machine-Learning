## 📈 Insights

- **Accuracy Curve**: Indicates model generalization and performance consistency.
- **Loss Plot**: Helps identify overfitting or underfitting.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes true vs predicted values (bucketed traffic categories if applicable).
- **Sample Input/Output**: Demonstrates real usage with visual inputs and predicted outputs.

These visuals were generated using Python's `matplotlib` and `seaborn` libraries during the training of our Gradient Boosting Regressor.
